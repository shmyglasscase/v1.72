## üéì Learning Path

### If you're new to React Native:
1. Read: [React Native Basics](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) (2 hours)
2. Read: [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) (1 hour)
3. Follow the examples in `README_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
4. Start building UI components one by one

### If you're familiar with React Native:
1. Review `CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md` (15 min)
2. Skim `README_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for patterns (30 min)
3. Jump right into Phase 1: UI Components

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Daily Development:
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm start

# 2. Open in browser
# Press 'w'

# 3. Make changes
# Edit files in src/
# See changes instantly (hot reload)

# 4. Test on mobile when needed
# Press 'i' for iOS
# Press 'a' for Android
```

### Weekly Testing:
- Test on iOS simulator
- Test on Android emulator
- Test on physical device (camera, notifications)

## üì± Key Differences from Web Development

### 1. No HTML/CSS
```javascript
// ‚ùå Web way:
<div className="container">
  <button className="btn-primary">Click</button>
</div>

// ‚úÖ React Native way:
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Button title="Click" onPress={handleClick} />
</View>
```

### 2. Use StyleSheet
```javascript
// ‚ùå No CSS files or Tailwind
// className="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded-lg"

// ‚úÖ StyleSheet API
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: '#3B82F6',
    padding: 16,
    borderRadius: 12,
  },
});
```

### 3. Different Navigation
```javascript
// ‚ùå react-router-dom
<Link to="/settings">Settings</Link>

// ‚úÖ React Navigation
navigation.navigate('Settings')
```

### 4. Platform-Specific Code
```javascript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

// Different behavior per platform
if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  // iOS specific
} else if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  // Android specific
} else {
  // Web specific
}
```

---

## üéØ Your First Task

**Create your first React Native component** (15 minutes):

1. Open `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
2. Copy the Button example from `README_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
3. Save the file
4. Import and test it in a screen

**Success**: You'll have a working, styled button that works on all platforms!

---

## üÜò If You Get Stuck

### Common Issues:
- **App won't start**: Run `npx expo start --clear`
- **Module not found**: Run `npm install` again
- **TypeScript errors**: Restart your editor
- **iOS won't open**: Make sure Xcode is installed (Mac only)

### Where to Get Help:
1. **First**: Check `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` troubleshooting section
2. **Second**: Search [Expo Forums](https://forums.expo.dev/)
3. **Third**: Check [Expo Discord](https://discord.gg/expo)
4. **Fourth**: Review [React Navigation docs](https://reactnavigation.org/)
